# Physics
## Newton's Laws
1) Every object in a state of uniform motion tends to remain in that state of motion,
2) Force equals to mass times acceleration.
3) For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction,
=> F=ma
(If the sum of F=0, v= constant)
## Newtonian Gravitation
* Particles attract other particles with a force directly proportional to the square of the distance between their centres and the product of their masses
=> G=universal gravitational constant = 6.67x101-11
=> F=(G m1m2) / (r^2)
=> r = distance from the centre of the earth
## Vectors
have magnitude and direction
- position vectors represent the position of P(x,y) in space in relation to an arbitrary reference point
